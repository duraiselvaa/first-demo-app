Steps:

a. Setting up a local repo:

cd C:
mkdir NewProject
cd NewProject
Now from Git Bash run:
git init

b. Create a new file (for example new.txt)

c. check the status using 

git status

d. stage the file for the next commit

git add new.txt

e. commit the newly created file to the local repo

git commit -m "my new file".

f. run the 

git status 

agin to check if the new file is commited - this means the working directory will be clean.

g. Add the remote repo 

git remote add origin git@github.com:duraiselvaa/Sample-MVC.git

f. Now merge the remote changes, using 

git pull git@github.com:duraiselvaa/Sample-MVC.git

this will pull any remote changes done by the owner or others. you will see some result like:

From github.com:duraiselvaa/Sample-MVC
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by recursive.
 NewTextFileAdded.txt |    1 +
 README.txt           |   51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++------
 2 files changed, 45 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 NewTextFileAdded.txt


g. Now push your local changes using:

git push origin master

Every time when we try to push or pull it will ask for your git password:

Enter passphrase for key '/c/Users/Others/.ssh/id_rsa':
Counting objects: 12, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Writing objects: 100% (10/10), 1.43 KiB, done.
Total 10 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:duraiselvaa/Sample-MVC.git
   e8225d2..f1d13bc  master -> master

now the local changes are commited to the remote repo.
